# AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02) Notes

**Welcome!** This is my personal lab journal as I work through the **AWS Certified Security Specialty (SCS-C02)** certification.

Iâ€™m currently following **Adrian Cantrillâ€™s in-depth AWS SCS course**, and documenting the hands-on labs, configurations, and lessons I learn as I build secure, real-world AWS environments. This repo captures both my technical progress and my commitment to mastering cloud security through practical experience.

## About Me

From the start of my career, Iâ€™ve been fueled by curiosity, discipline, and a passion for learning. I earned my **AAS in Network Design and Administration by age 18**, started as a **NOC Analyst I**, and was promoted to **NOC Analyst II** within three months â€” driven by my adaptability and eagerness to grow.

Iâ€™ve gained real-world experience working with **Cisco, Juniper, and Nokia equipment**, supporting complex **MPLS**, **DWDM**, and **fiber optic** networks. Alongside this, Iâ€™ve been steadily expanding into cloud technologies and cybersecurity â€” laying a foundation through certifications like **CompTIA Network+, Security+, and CySA+**.

Now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into cloud security. Iâ€™m actively preparing for the **AWS Security Specialty** and **CCSP** certifications â€” building practical skills and a strategic mindset to become a strong **Cloud Security Engineer** who can design, defend, and evolve secure cloud environments.
